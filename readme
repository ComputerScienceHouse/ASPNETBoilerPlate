CSH ASP.NET Boilerplate

This is just like the CSH React Boilerplate, a template for quickly getting started with auth in asp.NET

Information about the user can be accessed from any page through the User.Claims variable. This includes the name and username of whoever signed in.

Each claim has a type (the username is "preferred_username") and a value. These claims can only be accessed on pages, they cannot be access in program.cs or startup.cs

The specific information about the app (client secret, cliend id, and authoirity) all need to be passed in through enviroment variables (either in OKD or Properties/launchSettings.json)
